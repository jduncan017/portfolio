I am writing to recommend Joshua Duncan for roles in the tech industry. As the
General Manager of Adrift Tiki Bar, Josh not only demonstrated exceptional leadership, but also
problem-solving skills, adaptability, teamwork, and creativity. His leadership was instrumental in our
success, and I firmly believe that his diverse skill set, honed in the hospitality sector, will prove
invaluable in the tech industry.<br /><br />

Josh's adaptability and problem-solving prowess were particularly evident during the challenging times
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Josh's ability to completely reinvent our company's operating approach
and products to meet changing demands and guidelines showcased his nimbleness and strategic
thinking. His leadership in leveraging online ordering systems and delivery during this period resulted
in a successful relaunch, yielding sustainable profits through low-labor operations. Due to Josh's
decisions and problem-solving, Adrift quickly went from a shuttered operation to a highly sought-after
establishment.<br /><br />

In terms of teamwork and collaboration, Josh's skills were exemplary. He excelled at fostering an
environment where ideas from all team members were welcomed and valued. His effective
communication skills and ability to align team efforts with company goals are directly applicable to the
collaborative nature of modern business. Josh's experience creating an innovative organizational
environment will undoubtedly contribute to his ability to work effectively with cross-functional teams.<br /><br />

Josh's greatest strength lies in his ability to showcase creativity and innovation, leading to improved
processes and operational efficiencies. His organizational approach to overseeing multiple projects
simultaneously, particularly in research and development processes, resulted in radiant success for our
business. Under Josh's leadership, Adrift became a nationally recognized craft cocktail establishment, 
solidifying its position in the industry.<br /><br />

I am confident that Josh's unique background has equipped him with a valuable skill set that will
translate well into software engineering. His proven track record in problem-solving, adaptability,
teamwork, and organized creativity makes him an exceptional candidate for any role requiring strategic
thinking, innovation, and leadership.<br /><br />

    fullReview: `"After a couple months of struggling and stressing over building my dream website on Wix, I realized I needed a professional.
    I gave up the idea of building it alone, and was referred to Josh through my friend Marc.<br /><br />

    A unique pleasure of working with Josh is that he met with me in-person for our initial consultation. He took detailed notes and asked
    thoughtful questions to fully understand my needs and desires. Josh and I met on zoom several times to get my feedback as he built the site.
    Additionally, he was willing to help me via calls/texts WELL after business hours on multiple occasions. The response time was
    always fast, and I never waited longer than a couple hours to hear back from him.<br /><br />

    Josh not only helped me fine tune the layout/structure of my website, but also helped me with my logo design, color scheming, and definition of
    my brand. He went above and beyond what I originally thought I paid for, which is priceless to me as a young entrepreneur. The final
    product was sleek and well-designed. Josh was able to take my feedback along the way to shape and deliver exactly what I wanted, if not
    more! My clients have complimented me on how easy-to-maneuver and "sleek" my website is.<br /><br />

    I would recommend Josh over other developers not only because of the premium finished product, but also because he did
    a better job of making me feel comfortable and confident during the pricing process compared to anyone else I contacted.

    fullReview: `Joshua and I were on the same team of engineers during our SlopGoblins, NPO project. And a few things really stood out about how Joshua conducted himself.
    <br /><br />
    1. He's an excellent communicator and keeps the ball moving forward. Josh was consistently involved, always asking forward-thinking questions. He presented himself well during our tech calls and also during any e-communications in Jira and our team
      boards. His soft skills are not typical for an engineer, every team needs someone like this on their projects. <br /><br />

    2. His contributions always involved clean and readable code. It's not about finding just any solution... it's about finding the right solution with minimal,
     clean code. Joshua understands this and lives by it. <br /><br />

    3. He spends a healthy amount of time debugging and solving issues for the team. This is another rare thing for a Software Engineer to constantly stand up
     and offer professional and friendly feedback to his fellow engineers. Personality types like this make the whole team better. <br /><br />

    Overall, he's a skilled and reliable engineer who's positive mindset and hardworking attitude could uplift any team. <br /><br />
