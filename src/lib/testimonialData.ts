    Josh has consistently exhibited outstanding problem-solving skills, such as helping our business to survive the particularly challenging 
    times of the COVID-19 pandemic. Josh's ability to completely reinvent our company's operating approach and products to meet changing 
    demands and guidelines showcased his nimbleness and strategic thinking. His leadership in leveraging online ordering systems and delivery 
    during this period resulted in a successful relaunch, yielding sustainable profits through low-labor operations. Adrift quickly went from 
    a shuttered operation to a highly sought-after establishment due to Josh’s decisions and problem-solving.<br /><br />

    fullReview: `"After experiencing the quality, seamlessness, and professionalism of working with Josh, my business partner and I are 
    enthusiastic about providing a recommendation. <br /><br />
    
    Initially seeking a simple website for our woodworking business—a landing page for showcasing 
    our work and facilitating purchases—we ended up with precisely that and so much more. Josh's exceptional ability lies in his clear 
    communication throughout the process. He adeptly guides you through design, functionality, business insights, and associated costs. 
    What sets him apart is his honesty; he welcomes all ideas while offering insightful explanations for alternative approaches.<br /><br />

    shortDescription: `"Josh was able to take my feedback along the way to shape and deliver exactly what I wanted, if not 
    more! My clients have complimented me on how easy-to-maneuver and "sleek" my website is."`,
    fullReview: `"After a couple months of struggling and stressing over building my dream website on Wix, I realized I needed a professional. 
    I gave up the idea of building it alone, and was referred to Josh through my friend Marc.<br /><br />

    A unique pleasure of working with Josh is that he met with me in-person for our initial consultation. He took detailed notes and asked 
    thoughtful questions to fully understand my needs and desires. Josh and I met on zoom several times to get my feedback as he built the site. 
    Additionally, he was willing to help me via calls/texts WELL after business hours on multiple occasions. The response time was 
    always fast, and I never waited longer than a couple hours to hear back from him.<br /><br />

    Josh not only helped me fine tune the layout/structure of my website, but also helped me with my logo design, color scheming, and definition of 
    my brand. He went above and beyond what I originally thought I paid for, which is priceless to me as a young entrepreneur. The final 
    product was sleek and well-designed. Josh was able to take my feedback along the way to shape and deliver exactly what I wanted, if not 
    more! My clients have complimented me on how easy-to-maneuver and "sleek" my website is.<br /><br />

    I would recommend Josh over other developers not only because of the premium finished product, but also because he did 
    a better job of making me feel comfortable and confident during the pricing process compared to anyone else I contacted."`,
