    proactive, insightful and helpful. Josh showed a deep understanding of both frontend and backend development with a knack for

  //   I gave up the idea of building it alone, and was referred to Josh through my friend Marc.<br /><br />

  //   A unique pleasure of working with Josh is that he met with me in-person for our initial consultation. He took detailed notes and asked
  //   thoughtful questions to fully understand my needs and desires. Josh and I met on zoom several times to get my feedback as he built the site.
  //   Additionally, he was willing to help me via calls/texts WELL after business hours on multiple occasions. The response time was
  //   always fast, and I never waited longer than a couple hours to hear back from him.<br /><br />

  //   Josh not only helped me fine tune the layout/structure of my website, but also helped me with my logo design, color scheming, and definition of
  //   my brand. He went above and beyond what I originally thought I paid for, which is priceless to me as a young entrepreneur. The final
  //   product was sleek and well-designed. Josh was able to take my feedback along the way to shape and deliver exactly what I wanted, if not
  //   more! My clients have complimented me on how easy-to-maneuver and "sleek" my website is.<br /><br />

  //   I would recommend Josh over other developers not only because of the premium finished product, but also because he did
  //   a better job of making me feel comfortable and confident during the pricing process compared to anyone else I contacted."`,
