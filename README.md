## Ideas Site Improvements

- **Contact Form**: A contact form would be a nice improvement, especiall with the addition of a "comment box".
- **Testemonials**: Just waiting to get some testemonials back that I can add.
- **Modals**: A resuable modal would be nice to use in a few places around the site.
- **Icons for Technologies**: Instead of bullets, I want to display the technology icon.
- **Iframe for Resume**: Would be great to display the resume in a modal iframe instead of a separate site.
